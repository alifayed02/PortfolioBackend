Experience

NetCoro
May 2024 – Sep 2024
Software Engineer Intern
Santa Clara, CA
• Automated configuration of 150+ network devices by scripting Cisco DevNet API calls in Python, trimming manual
setup time ≈ 80% and cutting errors to <1%
• Fixed a production logout bug in under two hours using Python’s pdb, restoring stable auth flow for all active users
• Wrote a concise 10-page run-book & API guide that shrank new-contributor ramp-up from one week to two days

Projects

Resumate | Node.js, MySQL, OpenAI
Apr 2024 - Present
• Built LLM-driven agent that parses job posts and auto-crafts targeted resumes, delivering an 18% uplift in interview
call-backs for early adopters
• Designed a custom serialization layer (SQLAlchemy → S3) that streams resume versions for 100+ concurrent
users/request, achieving 90% storage-allocation efficiency and zero data-loss incidents
• Implemented an NLP pipeline (spaCy + custom word-cloud generator) with 98% keyword-extraction accuracy,
surfacing skills gaps and generating data-driven feedback in <3s per resume

2m | Node.js, OpenAI, GoLang, HTML/CSS/JS
Jan 2024 - Present
• Engineered a high-throughput, multithreaded Python/Go service that aggregates real-time CS2 skin pricing from 6
public APIs, sustaining 50K req/s with <150 ms latency during peak traffic
• Architected and deployed a web marketplace on AWS (PostgreSQL + Redis) that serves 200+ active traders and
processes 20K+ daily transactions across a multi-billion-row dataset
• Integrated an LLM-powered support chatbot (OpenAI / LangChain) with persistent SQL chat-history, cutting average
customer-issue resolution time by 42%

Ecobite | Python, Node.js, Tensorflow, Gemini
Feb 2025 - Feb 2025
• Fine-tuned a transfer-learning CNN in TensorFlow on a 5GB image dataset, achieving 83% weight-estimation
accuracy through k-fold cross-validation and stratified testing.
• Augmented the vision model with Google Gemini to infer food density, outperforming a purpose-built ML baseline and
enabling seamless horizontal scaling for real-time API calls.
• Accelerated training throughput 240x by orchestrating distributed GPU jobs on brev.dev, slashing wall-clock training
time from hours to minutes while trimming cloud-compute spend

Mai | Python, Firebase, OpenAI, Typescript, React
Dec 2024 - Feb 2025
• Fine-tuned a 7 B-parameter GPT-4-tier model with LoRA adapters on a curated mentorship corpus, increasing answer
precision from 78% → 94% while trimming per-query inference cost 1.5x
• Architected a sharded MongoDB + Redis stack that persists 12K+ dialog turns for 100+ monthly users, sustaining <80
ms median read latency and 99.995% uptime during peak load
• Shipped a mobile-first React/TypeScript UI with live WebSocket hints, hitting 96 Lighthouse and 40% week-1
retention
